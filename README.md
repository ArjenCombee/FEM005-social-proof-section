## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS Transition

### What I learned

In this project I used CSS grip with the area names. Seems a cool way to place content within the grid.

### Continued development

Working with background SVG's and the placement is somewhat easier, but still learning how to deal with correct image placement and customizing the CSS attribute's and declarations.
